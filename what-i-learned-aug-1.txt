:) What I learned this week:

  Javascript:
    DOM manipulation
    adding event listeners
    working with arrays and objects
    structuring a program
    prototype and pseudo-classes

:| What I thought I would learn, but didn't:
    design patterns in JS

:( What I struggled with:
    program structure
      what goes where?
      separate logic and view?
    attempting to implement TDD
      what to test?
      do I test the view as well? (integration / E2E)
    motivation
      blackjack isn't all that interesting

∆ What will I change for next week?
  • Do a public code review to get input on structure
  • take what I've learned, start a more interesting project (motivation)
  •
